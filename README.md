# Github--Classroom

Some random notes about using Github Classroom.
There are some resources that will help you understand how you can use Github Classroom to facilitate teaching.

My own journey started at this site:
https://education.github.community/t/my-guides-to-using-github-classroom-for-teachers-and-students/15717

From there, I was led to the author's guides to Github, which can be found here for teachers:
https://github.com/jfiksel/github-classroom-for-teachers

and here for students:
https://github.com/jfiksel/github-classroom-for-students

The idea is that Classroom makes it easy for students to set up 'clones' of our repositories such that their clones are private to everyone except you and that student.

The advice there is to set up a master organization and repository for each course you teach, and then fork from that 
to create a new instance of the course each subsequent year. I actually find it easier to simply fork each repository from the previous year's
version each new year, so I do that rather than creating a 'master' repo.

## Other random notes as I think of them:

* If you set all your directories up to be 'public' students will be able to fork from them regardless of whether or not they formally join the organzat5ion for the course.
* I send the invitations to the repositories for a given week via Blackboard (putting the message on the "Announcements" page on Blackboard for those who might miss the email.
* When student's create their repos, by accepting the invitations you send them, they will have the following properties
** You will be able to access those repos to read the material for grading purposes, for example, even though the repos are 'private'.
** Every time the create an issue, to say they have added answers to an assignment, for example, Github will send you a message to let you know.
** Github will also inform you of other messages they submit (e.g. committ messages) provided they include your Github ID in that message (e.g., "@pmarjora")
